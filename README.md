# UFOs
## Overview:
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. This project was inteded to create filters so that the user could navigate the data set by date, city, state, country, and shape.
## Results:
![no_filter ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106495685/187341810-2ed1487f-336e-48f2-a344-647b23843a84.png)

Previously, the webpage included only a date filter in which users needed to click on a button for the filter to be applied. With the new updated version, users can navigate the data simply by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. The webpage will then automatically filter the table to display relevant data. The first image ilustrates the table without filters. The second and third images show examples of the filters and how they display.
## Summary of Analysis:
One real issue of this webpage is that it lacks the ability to resize to work with all devises. It will adjust a bit but there are issues when opening the page on phones and tablets. For future development this is a good edit to look into.

Another addition that can be made to the webpage is a story board and or comment section so users can explain or share what they have seen in relation to ufos, the stories and comments could even be filtered along side the rest of the data.
